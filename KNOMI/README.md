# **KNOMI V1 INSTALL ON QIDI PLUS 4**

## ***---IMPORTANT---***
## These MACRO SCRIPT FILES are from my own QIDI PLUS 4 modifications in order to make KNOMI to work.
##


### :+1:Please be advise that these modifications are not PART of QIDI's own Klipper and therefor, i will not take any responsability for any issues that could prevail from using these scripts. I have also made many more adjusments that have been taken from the community page and that are fully integrated into these, thanks to crew of Discord, and that you can read here : [Qidi-Community](https://github.com/qidi-community/Plus4-Wiki/tree/main). :+1:

#### *** This install is fully working and should be followed very carefully. Do not forget that this MOD is based on the BEACON mod and is fully implemented for it but should FIT without it too except for some differences on the cover built :wink:*** ####
